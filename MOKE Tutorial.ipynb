    "# Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect (MOKE) Automation Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to an exploration of Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect (MOKE) automation using Python! In this tutorial, we'll understand how to automate MOKE experiments, making the process more efficient and insightful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pyvisa numpy pandas matplotlib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up the Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Libraries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import pyvisa\n",
    "    import numpy as np\n",
    "    import pandas as pd\n",
    "    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "    plt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8')\n",
    "    from MOKE import Experiment\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check Connected Devices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    rm = pyvisa.ResourceManager()\n",
    "    rm.list_resources()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialize MOKE Experiment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    E = Experiment()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Setting Parameters and Performing Measurement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Set your field value here\n",
    "    field_max = 100\n",
    "    num_points = 100\n",
    "    field = np.linspace(-field_max, field_max, num_points)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Set directory and filename here\n",
    "    save_dir = r\"C:\\Users\\physlab\\Desktop\\MOKE Automation\\Data\"\n",
    "    sample = 'NiFe_SPT4(50nm)'\n",
    "    filename = fr'{sample}_field_sweep_{field.min()}-{field.max()}_Oe'\n",
    "\n",
    "    E.sweep_field(field, save_dir, filename, read_reps=3, read_delay=0.002, sen=0.005)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Backend Script\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook provided in this tutorial automates the MOKE experiment using Python scripts. Here's a breakdown of key sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import time\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",
    "from srs_sr830 import SRS_SR830\n",
    "from bop50_8d import KEPCO_BOP\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This section imports necessary libraries and instrument classes (`SRS_SR830` and `KEPCO_BOP`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initializing the Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Experiment():\n",
    "    # ... \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Experiment` class initializes the MOKE experiment, sets default parameters, and establishes connections with the power supply and lock-in amplifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performing the Field Sweep\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sweep_field(self, fields, save_dir, filename, close_loop=False, livefig=True, savefig=True, closefig=False,\n",
    "                    file_prefix='', sen=0.002, sen_delay=None, read_reps=None, rep_delay=None,\n",
    "                    read_delay=None, from0delay=None, return_XY=False):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method performs the field sweep, updating the live plot during the experiment and saving data to a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses the `_sweep_parameter` function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def _sweep_parameter(self, params, setter_method, save_dir, livefig, savefig, closefig, sen,\n",
    "                     sen_delay, read_reps, rep_delay, read_delay, xrange, filename, close_loop):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The _sweep_parameter method facilitates the iteration over an array of parameter values, typically representing a sweep of magnetic field values. For each parameter value, it calls a specified setter_method to configure the instrument accordingly, such as setting the current in the power supply. Subsequently, X and Y values are acquired from the lock-in amplifier using the `readXY` method, accounting for sensitivity and data acquisition delays. These X and Y values are stored in arrays, and if real-time visualization is enabled (livefig=True), the method continuously updates a live plot using the `_update_sweep_plot` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading X and Y Values\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def readXY(self, read_reps, rep_delay, sen_delay):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method reads X and Y values from the lock-in amplifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to automating MOKE experiments using Python and the KEPCO BOP and SRS SR830 instruments. By understanding and customizing the provided Jupyter Notebook, you can adapt the experiment to your specific needs and analyze MOKE data efficiently."
